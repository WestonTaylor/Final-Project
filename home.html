                <p>No matter what kind of animal they are, we want to connect the right people with an animal they can love unconditionally. At the end of the day, what makes our club the proudest is when we join people with love to spare to animals that are desperately in need of it.</p>

                <p>While our club is well known for helping dogs find a home, our work does not stop there. There are also plenty of cats, birds, and other animals whcih are in just as much need for a nurturing environment. If you are unable to take care of a dog, do not be afraid to call you local shelter to see what other potential companions they may have.</p>
